## About me
I work as a programmer at a factory. I studied the web at the hobby level, however, over the past 1.5 years, a lot has changed: I graduated from html/css/js courses, got acquainted with react and php, realized that I liked it and wanted to change my place of work. During this time, I took several freelance jobs (page-proofs, work with js, OpenCart). My motivation is to settle well in life in order to provide for myself and my family (married, have a child) doing what I love.
